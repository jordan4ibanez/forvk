 You got Vulkan in my Fortran!

I have no idea what I'm doing.

![Womp womp womp womp](https://media.tenor.com/A_5FXBGEjkYAAAAM/yes.gif)

Something something deep quote about bringing the newest graphics api into the oldest language blah blah.

This program will probably blow up if you try to run it, but if you want to run it:

### Arch

```
sudo yay -S vulkan-devel glfw
```

Probably missing something there.

Let me know if it blows up, thanks.

## Note:
MacOS will need some fake data to bind to because Macs can't run vulkan.
